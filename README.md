## **SUMMARY**

When decompiling the Humankind assemblies back to source code we found **100+ hidden utility tools** used by Amplitude Studios to test, profile and develop the game.

Many of them are **a must have for mod developers** in order to test their mod in many different scenarios since they allow us to advance to a desired game state in no time.

From those 100+ hidden tools we only had the time to test 20-25 of them, of which only ~15 of them are successfully adapted and available right now. There are still many tools to check!
